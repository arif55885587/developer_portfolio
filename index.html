                              function, efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond the most popular javascript
                              framework
                              called Vue JS. I even know the deployment,server and security. I will give you 100% web
                              solution.

                              showed it to them. They liked it. And uploded the content. It was fun working at
